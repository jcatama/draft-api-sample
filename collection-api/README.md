# Collection API Sample

A sample application to help you integrate the Gamma Collection API Mint into your React app.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the configs by modifying `.env`.

In this project, we use Next JS [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) to hide API calls from the client, especially the API key.
